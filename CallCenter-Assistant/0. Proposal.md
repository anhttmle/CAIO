# Proposal: AI-powered Knowledge Centralization & Call Center Automation

## 1. Problem Statement
Legacy Call Center has stored **audio recordings in Japanese** between users and human agents.  
Current challenges:
- **Language barrier**: Not supported in other languages.
- **Knowledge lock-in**: Insights in recordings are not reusable.
- **Scalability issue**: Lack of human agents to support increasing user demand.

**Goal:** Transform legacy audio into a **multilingual, reusable knowledge base** and build an **AI-first call center system** with human-in-the-loop (HITL) for reliability and scalability.

---

## 2. Solution Overview

### Phase 1: Knowledge Centralization
- Convert Japanese audio → text via **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)**.
- Translate into other languages (VN/EN) via **NMT (Neural Machine Translation)**.
- Extract **knowledge objects**: QA pairs, summaries, SOPs.
- Store results in a **Knowledge Database** (construct under a knowledge graph) for retrieval.

### Phase 2: System Development
Design system to support different levels of human-AI collaboration:

1. **Proposal 1 – Human Enhancement**  
   AI assists agents with fast reference answers, but **agent remains primary responder**.  
   → Boosts **productivity**.

2. **Proposal 2 – Human Supervision**  
   AI generates answers, human agents **review/approve** before delivery.  
   → Balances **automation + control**.

3. **Proposal 3 – Human as Support**  
   AI answers directly; human pool is called **only for low-confidence or edge cases**.  
   → Maximizes **scalability**.

4. **Proposal 4 - Combine all 3 into an AI-first HITL framework** 
- Default: AI responds (Proposal 3).  
- Escalation: Human approves (Proposal 2).  
- Agents use AI as co-pilot in complex cases (Proposal 1).

## 3. Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Poor ASR due to noise/dialects | Fine-tune ASR, pre-process audio, diarization |
| Translation errors | Human post-edit for canonical KB |
| AI hallucinations | Use **RAG + citations + confidence thresholds** |
| Data privacy | Apply **PII redaction, encryption, access control** |
| Cost scaling | Hybrid infra: managed + self-host; optimize inference |

---

## 4. Team & Resource Estimate
- **Product Owner / PM**: 1  
- **ML Engineers (ASR, embeddings, retriever)**: 1–2  
- **Backend / Infra Engineer**: 1  
- **Frontend Engineer (Agent UI)**: 1  
- **Data Annotators (QA extraction, translation post-edit)**: 1–2  
- **DevOps/MLOps**: 1  

**Timeline to MVP:** ~3–4 months.

---

## 5. Expected Impact
- Unlocks **hidden knowledge** from legacy recordings.  
- Enables **multilingual support** (JP, EN, VN).  
- Reduces reliance on limited human agents.  
- Improves **response time, scalability, and consistency**.  
- Provides **continuous learning system** that gets better over time.

---

## 6. Next Steps
1. Select 500–1000 sample calls for **POC testing**.  
2. Evaluate ASR/NMT performance & select best models.  
3. Stand up **vector DB + retrieval pipeline**.  
4. Build minimal **RAG assistant with human-in-loop**.  
5. Measure automation rate & agent productivity uplift.
