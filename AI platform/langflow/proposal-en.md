  - Manual conflict resolution required for each update.
  - High risk of errors during merges.
  
- **2. High Maintenance Cost**
  - Manual porting required for each upstream update.
  - High effort to maintain a separate fork.
  - Full regression testing required after every merge.
  
- **3. Scalability Issues**
  - Difficult to scale for multiple languages.
  - Code duplication per language.
  - No code reusability.
  
- **4. Technical Debt**
  - Divergence from upstream.
  - Technical debt accumulates over time.

### 2. Develop an Adapter to Compile Source Code
<details>
  
<summary>Implementation Strategy</summary>

- **Frontend Adapter**:
  - Use React i18n library (react-i18next).
  - Translation files (JSON) for Japanese.
  - Language switcher component.
  - Translation wrapper components.
  
- **Backend Adapter**:
  - i18n middleware for FastAPI.
  - Translated API responses.
  - Error message translations.
  - Database field translations.
  
- **Build Integration**:
  - Pre-build hook: Extract strings.
  - Translate using AI + human review.
  - Post-build hook: Inject translations.
  - Version control for translation files.
  
- **Sync Mechanism**:
  - Weekly sync with upstream.
  - Detect new strings that need translation.
  - Auto-translate using LLM.
  - Human review required.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Advantages:</summary>

- **1. Maintain Sync with Upstream**
  - Easy synchronization through automation.
  - Weekly sync with minimal manual work.
  - Auto-detects new strings needing translation.
  
- **2. Lower Maintenance Cost**
  - Automated sync reduces manual work by ~80%.
  - Team can focus on feature work instead of porting.
  
- **3. Scalability**
  - Easy to add more languages (English, Chinese, Korean, etc.).
  - Unified multi-language infrastructure.
  - Independent translation files, easy to manage.
  - One adapter covers all languages.
  
- **4. Reusable Architecture**
  - Adapter pattern reusable across projects.
  - Standardized translation pipeline.
  - Promotes enterprise localization best practices.
  
- **5. Lower Technical Risk**
  - Isolated adapter layer, no need to modify core.
  - Upstream changes donâ€™t break adapter.
  - Easier testing and debugging.
  - Cleaner separation of concerns.
      
- **7. Professional Standards**
  - Enterprise-grade architecture.
  - Aligned with industry best practices.
  - Easier onboarding for new developers.
  - Better code organization.
  
- **8. Flexibility**
  - Easy runtime language switching.
  - No redeploy required for translation updates.
  - Hot reload for translations.
   
</details>

<details>
<summary>Disadvantages:</summary>

- **1. Initial Setup Complexity**
  - Higher initial setup cost (~$20k additional).
  - Requires adapter architecture design.
  - Sync mechanism implementation needed.
  - Implementation time extended by one month (4 vs 3).
  
- **2. Performance Overhead**
  - Slight build time increase (~10%).
  
- **3. Infrastructure Requirements**
  - Needs infrastructure for adapter and pipeline.
  - More complex CI/CD setup.
  - Requires a translation management system.
  - Storage for translation files.
  
- **4. Learning Curve**
  - Team must learn adapter pattern and i18n library (react-i18next).
  - Additional training and documentation needed.
  
- **5. Dependency on Translation Files**
  - Translation files must be maintained separately.
  - Risks if files are missing.
  - Requires version control for translations.
  - Migration complexity when changing file format.
