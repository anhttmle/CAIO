# üöß 1. Problem

* Data from **Driver** and **Vehicle** is captured using **Edge Devices** installed on vehicles. Specifically:

  * **Driver Identification Data** (e.g. face recognition) is used to determine which driver is operating the vehicle (from \~10,000 drivers).
  * **Vehicle Operational Data** (e.g. speed, braking, GPS, environment) is used to understand the behavior and context of the driver at any given moment.
* All data from Edge Devices is uploaded to **Cloud Storage** for archival and further processing.
* **Police Reports** are submitted periodically, detailing safety risks across different road segments.
* **Supervisors** access this combined data to generate safety evaluations for each **Driver**, **Driver Team**, or **Department**, based on:

  * Driver and Vehicle data from Cloud Storage
  * Reports from Police authorities

> ‚úÖ **Core Problem to Solve**: Automate the report generation and evaluation work traditionally handled by human Supervisors.

### (1) Edge Data Capture

* Captures real-time identity and behavior of Driver + Vehicle.
* Already implemented and deployed.

### (2) Cloud Ingestion

* Securely uploads and stores raw data to Cloud Storage.
* Already implemented and functioning.

### (3) Data Preparation Strategies (Optional)

* **Pre-compute**: Pre-process and store important features; reduces latency during report generation but increases storage costs.
* **On-the-fly compute**: Compute features only when required; increases latency but reduces storage cost.

### (4) GenAI-Powered Analytics Engine

* Leverages **ChatGPT API** to analyze vehicle data and generate reports.
* Outputs include summaries, driver scores, and highlighted evidence (video, logs, GPS anomalies).

### (5) Supervisor Dashboard

* A web-based application to:

  * Request reports for Driver / Team / Department
  * Review GenAI-generated reports along with supporting evidence
  * Ask questions in natural language (RAG or ChatGPT API backend)
