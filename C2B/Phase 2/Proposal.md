# Proposal 1: 
## Product-first Approach
-  Focus on transforming the POC into a stable, demo-ready, trial-capable product that is prepared for scale
 
## Workload:
- AI (LOW): maintain only, minor adjustment
- SE (MEDIUM): develop product with minimal feature which is similar to POC

## Pros:
- Cheap
- Fast
- Clear

# Cons: 
- Hard to scale in future when:
  - more users
  - more use-case
  - SLA
- High maintenance cost

# Proposal 2: 
## Commercialization-first Approach

## Workload:
- AI (MEDIUM): maintain and adjust base on product feature
- SE (HIGH): develop comprehensive product

## Pros:

## Cons:

# Proposal 3:
## Technology-first Approach (AI Driven)
## Workload:
- AI (HIGH): maintain and research on next generation assistant (agentic)
- SE:
  - **MEDIUM**: develop product with minimal feature which is similar to POC
  - **HIGH**: develop comprehensive product

## Pros:

## Cons:
