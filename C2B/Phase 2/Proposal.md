# Proposal 1: 
### Product-first Approach
-  Focus on transforming the POC into a stable, demo-ready, trial-capable product that is prepared for scale.
 
### Workload:
- AI (LOW): Maintain only, minor adjustments.
- SE (MEDIUM): Develop product with minimal features, similar to POC.



### Pros:
- Cheap
- Fast to deliver
- Clear scope and team alignment

### Cons: 
- Hard to scale in the future (more users, more use cases, SLA...)
- High maintenance cost (due to early tech debt & lack of abstraction)

# Proposal 2: 
### Commercialization-first Approach
- Focus on creating a well-rounded, feature-complete product ready for onboarding multiple customers and use cases, with solid ops and admin capabilities.

### Workload:
- AI (MEDIUM): maintain and adjust base on product feature
- SE (HIGH): develop comprehensive product



### Pros:
- Ready for pilot with real customers
- Easy to demo, sell, and train users
- Better long-term stability, structure for ops/admin
- Enables billing, monitoring, onboarding, and multiple-user handling

### Cons:
- Higher cost and potential slower delivery than **Proposal 1**
- Risk of building features before validating customer demand
- AI component may lag behind in innovation without parallel investment

# Proposal 3:
### Technology-first Approach (AI Driven)
- Invest heavily in improving the Assistantâ€™s intelligence, accuracy, and long-term capabilities, even beyond initial market needs.

### Workload:
- AI (HIGH):  Maintain current system and research next-generation assistant (agentic behavior, context awareness, few-shot learning, etc.)
- SE:
  - **MEDIUM**: Develop product with minimal features (similar to POC)
  - **HIGH** (optional): Develop full product alongside AI innovations



### Pros:
- Best long-term bet for competitive advantage
- Unlocks deep tech IP: semantic retrievers, code reasoning, SME-driven feedback loops
- Easier to differentiate from competitors (especially low-code tools or static doc generators)

### Cons:
- High R&D cost and team complexity
- Risk of overengineering before business validation
- Product might lag in usability/commercial features
