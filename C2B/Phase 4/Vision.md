# Ultimate Goal
Restructure-AI (**ReAI**) system **centralizes work-load from transforming legacy projects** like COBOL to modern ones
Some main features that ReAI can have to assist human on the transformation

- ReAI help analyze source code COBOL to **build up projects specs** (_Phase 1-2-3_)
- ReAI help providing answer through **Q&A about source code, biz, calendar, roadmap, workload, progress,...**
- ReAI can be **fit into ecosystem of software development** (calendar, project management, issue tracking, ...)  => ReAI will treat them as tools to call
- ReAI will **collab with humans**
  - ReAI **plans** & **executes**
  - Human provide **domain knowledge**, **review** result from ReAI and make **adjustment**
  
# ReAI collaborates tighly with humans
- Like proposal from [Phase 1](https://github.com/anhttmle/CAIO/blob/main/C2B/%5B0%5D%20Proposal.md#a-by-level-of-automation)
- In ReAI, instead of build unique workflow we **should build multiple level of automation & collaboration between AI <-> Humans**
  - **Level 0**: Humans **manually** do everything
    > **ReAI provide editor so user can manually do their job**
  - **Level 1**: Humans get **recommendation from AI** when **manually** doing their work
    > **ReAI automatically provides recommendation when user manually operate on editor**
  - **Level 2**: Humans request AI to do some specific piece of work and humans reviews/adjusts the result
    > ****
  - Human let AI do a complex work and reviewing step by step (level 3)
  - Human let AI do a complex work and reviewing final result (level 4)
- And will apply to each module of ReAI. Such as:
  - Documentation
  - Planing
  - Management
  - Development
  - Testing   

# System's components
