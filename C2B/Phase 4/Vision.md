# Ultimate Goal
Restructure-AI (ReAI) system centralizes work-load from transforming legacy projects like COBOL to modern ones
Some main features that ReAI can have to assist human on the transformation

- ReAI help analyze source code COBOL (_Phase 1-2-3_)
- ReAI help providing answer through Q&A about source code, biz, calendar, roadmap, workload, progress,...
- ReAI can be fit into ecosystem of software development (calendar, task management, ... as tool)
- ReAI will collab with human
  - ReAI plans & executes
  - Human provide domain knowledge, review result from ReAI and make adjustment

- Multiple level of automation
- Apply to each module
  - Understanding  
  - Documentation
  - Planing
  - Management
  - Development
  - Testing
