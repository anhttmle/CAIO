# Ultimate Goal
Restructure-AI (**ReAI**) system **centralizes work-load from transforming legacy projects** like COBOL to modern ones
Some main features that ReAI can have to assist human on the transformation

- ReAI help analyze source code COBOL to **build up projects specs** (_Phase 1-2-3_)
- ReAI help providing answer through **Q&A about source code, biz, calendar, roadmap, workload, progress,...**
- ReAI can be **fit into ecosystem of software development** (calendar, project management, issue tracking, ...)  => ReAI will treat them as tools to call
- ReAI will **collab with human**
  - ReAI **plans** & **executes**
  - Human provide **domain knowledge**, **review** result from ReAI and make **adjustment**
  
# Mindset (like the [1st proposal](https://github.com/anhttmle/CAIO/blob/main/C2B/%5B0%5D%20Proposal.md))
- Multiple level of automation
  - Human can do everything (level 0)
  - Human can ask AI to support at specific piece of work (level 1)
  - Human let AI do a complex work and reviewing step by step (level 2)
  - Human let AI do a complex work and reviewing final result (level 3)
- Apply to each module
  - Documentation
  - Planing
  - Management
  - Development
  - Testing
